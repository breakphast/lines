# Lines

**Lines** is a simple yet powerful tool designed to assist you in handicapping sports bets. Leveraging `theOddsAPI`, Lines provides odds from the NHL and NBA, presenting each betting option alongside the corresponding sportsbook logo that offers the best odds for that bet.

By default, the app operates with mock data, allowing you to explore its features immediately. To access live odds, simply register for your own API key by entering your email at [the-odds-api.com](https://the-odds-api.com/#get-access). Once you have your key, save it in the `CustomSetup.swift` file in the project.

## Technologies Used

- 🏀 **TheOddsAPI**: REST API for fetching live sports betting odds.
